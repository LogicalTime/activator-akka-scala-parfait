<title>Akka Dependency Injection with the Parfait Pattern</title>

<div>
<h2>Akka Dependency Injection using Parfait</h2>
<p>
The parfait pattern is, to some degree, a variation of the cake pattern
but using implicits rather than traits to pass the configuration
throughout an application. Rather than replacing Cake (which still
offers some unique features), think of parfait as an alternative to
solutions like Guice, but with many of the advantages of cake (such
as complete compile time verifiability). In addition, the use of
implicit parameters opens up some possibilities that even cake does
not provide.
</p>

<p>
  This template is based on the
  <a href="https://github.com/rocketraman/activator-akka-scala-guice#master" target="_blank">akka-scala-guice</a>
  template, which in turn is based on the
  <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/activator-akka-java-spring" target="_blank">akka-java-spring</a>
  template. If you are familiar with Guice and/or Spring, comparing this template
  with those may help you understand the conversion. Where modules have been
  renamed, I have mentioned the old names in the comments.
</p>
<p>
  Parfait is an arbitrary name (somewhat like cake) assigned because of the layered
  nature of the configuration traits, and because a name is useful to refer to
  an approach or pattern. This pattern is actually very open-ended and may be used
  in multiple different ways to achieve the goal of configurable dependencies. One
  such approach is demonstrated here, along with some warnings about possible pitfalls
  and some examples of desirable features, particularly with respect to injecting
  singleton objects (often hard in alternative dependency injection solutions).
  However it is anticipated that this approach could be customized, tweaked or
  otherwise improved on. The bones are here, flesh out the rest as you desire.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Anatomy - Modules</h2>
<p>
  The core of Parfait is, like Cake, configuration module traits with abstract members.
  Typically there are more than one of these modules within a large enough application
  and they are purely virtual, but with one or more concrete implementations for each.
</p>
<p>
  While we will dig into details later, for now within our example app you can take a
  look at the three configuration modules, and their <em>standard</em> implementations.
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/config/ConfigModule.scala" class="shortcut">ConfigModule.scala</a>,
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/AuditModule.scala" class="shortcut">AuditModule.scala</a> and
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingModule.scala" class="shortcut">CountingModule.scala</a>
  are the three pure-virtual configuration modules in this sample app, and underneath them
  you will see implementations that provide concrete values. Don't worry too much about the
  implementations yet, as you may see some unfamiliar concepts in there but we will touch on
  them later in the tutorial.

<div>
<h2>Anatomy - Actors</h2>
<p>
  Our demonstration system uses akka actors, specifically those in the files:
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/Audit.scala" class="shortcut">Audit.scala</a> and
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">CountingActor.scala</a>.
  These actors are written using common practices for akka, in particular defining
  the <code>props</code> method in the companion object to the Actor class.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">CountingActor</a>
  uses <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingService.scala" class="shortcut">CountingService</a>,
  a utility class to increment a counter variable by a configured amount when called.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Anatomy - Main and Tests</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main</a> class
  used to run the application holds the code to set up the standard configuration
  using the standard configuration modules. These are used to access countingActors
  and send messages, after which we can retrieve the accumulated counts and show
  their values. This represents an albeit simple system running in production mode.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="#code/src/test/scala/sample/CountingActorSpec.scala" class="shortcut">CountingActorSpec</a>
  test shows the power of dependency injection, using overrides in the configuration
  to substitute in alternative implementations of pieces of the system for testing
  purposes. <a href="#code/src/test/scala/sample/TestCountingService.scala" class="shortcut">TestCountingService</a>
  provides a <code>CountingService</code> implementation that lets us inspect the
  number of times the counter was called to ensure that the actor code is doing
  its job.
</p>
<p>Now you have the lay of the land, let's take a more detailed look at each of these
  pieces in turn</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Config Module</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/config/ConfigModule.scala" class="shortcut">ConfigModule</a>
  provides a simple example of how configuration can be defined and then implemented for parfait.
  The <code>ConfigModule</code> trait itself provides two members:
  <pre><code>    def config: Config
    def actorSystem: ActorSystem</pre></code>
  these are pure abstract members, in other words they have a type but no supplied
  implementation. We know that <code>config</code> will be of type
  <code>com.typesafe.config.Config</code> and <code>actorSystem</code> will
  be of type <code>akka.actor.ActorSystem</code>, and we know that implementations of
  those types will be available in any concrete class extending <code>ConfigModule</code>
  due to the rules of the Scala language, but nothing is implied about what that
  implementation will be other than it will conform to those types.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation in <code>AkkaConfigModule</code> provides one such set of
  concrete definitions. In this case, the <code>config</code> holds the result of
  the default <code>ConfigFactory.load()</code> invocation, while <code>actorSystem</code>
  is set up to be a new <code>ActorSystem</code> with the name <code>"main-actor-system"</code>
  and using the config we loaded by default.
</p>
<p>
  When we want to use a standard configuration for our application with these values,
  we can make items that need these dependencies specify a <code>ConfigModule</code>
  must be supplied, but provide an <code>AkkaConfigModule</code> as the implementation
  of that configuration. Alternatively, we could substitute in another implementation
  in the case of wanting something non-standard. Any sub-type of <code>ConfigModule</code>
  will satisfy that requirement.
</p>
<p>
  One more thing to notice about the <code>AkkaConfigModule</code> is the use of
  <code>lazy val</code>s. Although it should be safe in this specific case to use
  a regular (or eager) val, generally in traits it is a better idea to use a
  <code>lazy val</code> defensively for anything beyond a trivial assignment
  of a constant. The reason is that traits initialize vals before the instance
  they are being mixed into has been initialized (or indeed sometimes before
  other traits within the same instance). If this happens, it is possible that
  a value this val is relying on may not have been initialized yet, and this leads
  to unexpected outcomes, including null pointer exceptions during initialization.
</p>
<p>
  This tends to be more important when using dependency injection because configuration
  traits tend to build up deeply and it can be difficult to keep track of
  initialization ordering. The general rule of thumb is to use either <code>def</code>
  or <code>lazy val</code> for any trait definition beyond a simple constant.
  <code>def</code>s are evaluated each time they are used, whereas <code>lazy val</code>
  is evaluated once on first use, then cached and that value used on all subsequence
  calls.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Audit Module</h2>
<p>
  The Config Module just examined is used to read in the configuration and set up
  the actor system. The
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/AuditModule.scala" class="shortcut">AuditModule</a>
  is a separate configuration module providing <code>auditCompanion</code> and
  <code>auditBus</code> actor references. Again the <code>AuditModule</code>
  is a pure abstract trait, and the <code>StandardAuditModule</code> provides
  a standard set of definitions for these fields.
</p>
<p>
  This time there is a twist however. In order to create the actor refs we need
  the configuration, so we use a
  <a href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/02/scala-self-type-annotations-for.html"
    target="_blank">Self type</a> to make the <code>StandardAuditModule</code> dependent
  on there being a <code>ConfigModule</code> present when used in a concrete instance.
  The self type is specified by <code>this: ConfigModule =></code> in the trait
  definition.
</p>
<p>
  Since the <code>ConfigModule</code> must be present and implemented when
  <code>StandardAuditModule</code> is used, we know we can use the <code>actorSystem</code>
  defined within it to create our actor references.
</p>
<p>
  The use of self types is comparable to the cake pattern, but in parfait it is only used
  in the configuration module layer for requiring configuration dependencies there. For
  injection into classes, and other functioning code a different mechanism is used: implicit parameters.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>AuditBus and AuditCompanion</h2>
<p>
  To examine the use of implicit parameters to pass in configuration, let's jump into
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/Audit.scala" class="shortcut">Audit.scala</a>.
  The first class and companion in this file: <code>AuditBus</code> does not declare
  or use any dependencies, it's a straight up simple Akka Actor. The <code>receive</code>
  method in the Actor class receives <code>AuditBus.AuditEvent</code> messages and
  logs them to stdout. Note also the <code>props</code> method in the companion:
  <pre><code>    def props = Props(new AuditBus)</code></pre>
  Putting the Props for an actor into the companion object is a common and recommended
  way to provide the Props for a new actor ref.
</p>
<p>
  Now let's take a look at
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/Audit.scala" class="shortcut">AuditCompanion</a>
  in the same file. This is also a simple Akka Actor, but this time it requires
  some configuration be passed in. This is where parfait diverges from the cake
  pattern.
</p>
<p>
  The constructor for <code>AuditCompanion</code> requires that an <code>AuditModule</code>
  configuration module is passed in. This is marked as <code>implicit</code>, meaning
  that the compiler can search for and fill it in implicitly if it's not explicitly
  provided, <b>and also</b> places it in implicit scope within the body of the
  <code>AuditCompanion</code> class:

  <pre><code>  class AuditCompanion(implicit auditModule: AuditModule) extends Actor</code></pre>

  It is this combination of both things that
  <code>implicit</code> enables that makes parfait work as it does, as we will see
  shortly.
</p>
<p>
  Because the <code>AuditModule</code> is available to the <code>AuditCompanion</code>,
  configuration can be used from it:
  <pre><code>  val auditBus = auditModule.auditBus</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Finally the companion object for <code>AuditCompanion</code> still has a <code>props</code>
  method, but since the <code>AuditCompanion</code> actor it creates needs the
  <code>AuditConfig</code>, we pass it in to <code>props</code> as well:
  <pre><code>  def props(implicit auditModule: AuditModule) =
    Props(new AuditCompanion)</code></pre>
  Because it is marked implicit in the parameter list, we don't have to specify
  it when creating a new <code>AuditCompanion</code> because the compiler will
  do that for us. This is one of the big advantages of parfait; while objects
  usually cannot be injected because they are initialized before the DI frameworks
  can get involved, with parfait you can simply pass implicit configuration into
  the method instead if that makes more sense (like it does here).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>CountingActor</h2>
<p>
  Let's take a look at
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">CountingActor</a>.
  This uses another module that we have not yet seen, but we'll take a look at that
  in a minute.
</p>
<p>
  Like <code>AuditCompanion</code>, <code>CountingActor</code> passes implicit configuration
  through its <code>props</code> method to the Actor implementation. In this case
  the configuration is <code>SystemModule</code> which as we will see is a combination
  of the various configuration for the whole system (but could equally be a
  combination of several configuration modules without needing to include every piece
  of configuration). The Actor uses <code>auditCompanion</code> from
  <code>AuditModule</code>, and also <code>countingService</code> from the
  <code>CountingModule</code> (soon).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>CountingModule and SystemModule</h2>
<p>
  This is where config starts to get interesting. It is common in larger applications
  to combine individual configuration modules together into larger configuration modules
  as you go further up the system heirarchy (and into code that uses subsystems
  requiring different configuration modules).
</p>
<p>
  First, let's see
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingModule.scala" class="shortcut">CountingModule</a>.
  This, like the other modules we have seen, declares pure abstract members, in this
  case:
  <pre><code>    val countingActor: ActorRef
    def countingService: CountingService</code></pre>
  We are using a <code>val</code> for countingActor to require that the value never
  change within a configuration module. Only vals (or lazy vals) may override it
  now.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>StandardCountingModule</code> trait relies on another trait, <code>SystemModule</code>
  using self types again. This is where things start to get interesting though, if we take a look
  at the definition for
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/SystemModule.scala" class="shortcut">SystemModule</a>:
  <pre><code>  trait SystemModule extends CountingModule
    with AuditModule with ConfigModule</code></pre>
  So, <code>SystemModule</code> combines the <code>CountingModule</code>,
  <code>AuditModule</code> and <code>ConfigModule</code> configurations into one
  super configuration that we can use instead of having to specify them each
  separately each time.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Implicit Parameters and Sub-types</h2>
<p>
  Since <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingModule.scala" class="shortcut">CountingModule</a>
  specifies a self type of <code>SystemModule</code>, we know that we have <code>AuditModule</code>
  and <code>ConfigModule</code> configuration available too, and we use that in the Actor:
  <pre><code>  val auditCompanion = systemModule.auditCompanion</code></pre> and
  <pre><code>    count = systemModule.countingService.increment(count)</code></pre>
  for example.
</p>
<p>
  Even more conveniently, since <code>SystemModule</code> is implicit in the class, if
  we were to create a new instance of a class that requires one of the component
  configurations, because <code>SystemModule</code> is a sub-type of those other
  configurations, it will be found and used. E.g. if a new class:
  <pre><code>  class Example(implicit configModule: ConfigModule)</code></pre>
  is defined, we can still create a new one in <code>CountingActor</code>
  with a simple
  <pre><code>    new Example</code></pre> and it will work because Scala will fill
  in the implicit <code>ConfigModule</code> using the implicit <code>SystemModule</code>
  since it is a sub-type.
</p>
<p>This behavior, along with the chaining of implicit parameters, is the key to
  the parfait pattern.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Providing the Configuration at Run Time</h2>
<p>
  Now that we have the configuration, and the pieces that rely on it, we need to bring
  them together for a running system. This is usually done at the highest level
  of your app (the <code>main</code> method typically) where you set up an aggregated
  system configuration and pass it in to the first classes you create that need it (or
  factory methods that use it). After that, the implicit configuration is handed
  down to child classes automatically by Scala <em>but also may be replaced explicitly
  at any level if desired</em> (another advantage of parfait).
</p>
<p>
  Take a look at the
  <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut">Main</a> class. The
  concrete configuration to be used is provided by this code:
  <pre><code>  implicit val config: SystemModule =
    new SystemModule with StandardCountingModule
    with StandardAuditModule with AkkaConfigModule {}</code></pre>
  which mixes together all of our standard implementations into a single implicit
  configuration, then where we say <code>config.countingActor</code> we now
  get a fully configured actor. Likewise if we wanted to create a new class that
  took the configuration implicitly as a constructor parameter, we could do so
  because that config instance is marked as implicit.
</p>
<p>
  If a child class needs some configuration, but the parent class has "broken" the
  implicit passing chain, you will get a compile error that tells you. Likewise, if
  a subsystem requires configuration that the parent does not provide, you will
  get a compile error for that as well. Scala will not let you fail to provide
  a dependency using parfait resulting in a runtime error, although you can still
  always write faulty code that gives back a null or some other runtime exception
  (hint: don't do that :-) ).
</p>
<p>
  Organizing the individual configuration traits into grouped traits is a good
  idea because it means if you introduce a new configuration trait in the future, you
  can add it into those grouped traits and avoid having to change lots of declarations
  all over the code. Experience will give you a good idea of how best to organize
  these grouped traits for the easiest code maintenance experience.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Testing with Parfait</h2>
<p>
  Of course, if we always use a standard configuration, dependency injection is
  a bit pointless. The easy substitution of different, compile time verified,
  implementations for the dependencies is the point. An example of this is during
  testing where you might want to substitute in alternative implementations, e.g.
  fakes, mocks and verifiers.
</p>
<p>
  Our extensive :-) test suite for this project lives in
  <a href="#code/src/test/scala/sample/CountingActorSpec.scala" class="shortcut">CountingActorSpec</a>
  and makes use of
  <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/testing.html#Asynchronous_Integration_Testing_with_TestKit"
  target="_blank">Akka's TestKit</a>, which allows a testing actor system to be configured
  and used for testing purposes and gives extra introspection options allowing
  actor traffic to be observed, etc.
</p>
<p>
  By using the Akka TestKit we get a test scoped actor system to use under the field name
  <code>_system</code>. To make use of this, plus a fake
  <a href="#code/src/test/scala/sample/TestCountingService.scala">TestCountingService</a>
  that lets us check how many times the counter was called, we define the implicit
  configuration with the standard settings (just like in the <code>Main</code> runner)
  but override a couple of values when we do so (see lines 28-29):
  <pre><code>    override lazy val actorSystem: ActorSystem = _system
    override lazy val countingService =
      new TestCountingService()(this)</code></pre>
  These overrides in our implicit configuration mean that the <code>_system</code>
  test actor system, and <code>TestCountingService</code> will be injected when those
  items are needed. This is the power of Dependency Injection and the simplicity
  of the Parfait pattern. Simply override the items you want. Alternatively, if you
  have a common testing configuration that you use repeatedly, you can also set up
  a new re-useable configuration object with the values you want and make that
  implicit in the test.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>"send messages to its audit companion"</code> test shows another test
  with a different configuration, still using the <code>_system</code> actor system
  but this time substituting in our own <code>auditCompanionProbe</code> based on
  an Akka TestProbe (which lets us examine the messages that were sent to it).
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Advantages and Gotchas</h2>
<p>
  So that's Parfait in a nutshell. Some of the advantages of this approach include:
  <ul>
    <li>Full compile time verifiability</li>
    <li>Full control over singleton/scoped/instance injections, use lazy val / def
      etc. where each makes sense</li>
    <li>Just standard Scala code, no extra libraries, macros, compiler plugins</li>
    <li>Easy run-time reconfiguration programmatically - simply change the implicit
      (or explicit) module passed down to children</li>
    <li>Faster to compile than the full cake approach on large projects</li>
    <li>Can pass configuration implicitly into methods (e.g. on objects) like we
      see here with the <code>props</code> object methods for actor initialization.</li>
  </ul>
  There are some gotchas to watch out for though:
  <ul>
    <li>When using traits with implicit members, watch out for name clashes:
      <pre><code>  trait Inj1 {
    implicit def config: DbConfig
  }

  trait Inj2 {
    implicit def config: WebServiceConfig
  }

  trait Mega extends Inj1 with Inj2   // oops</code></pre>
  To avoid this, either avoid implicit config fields in the traits, or use
  names that match the types:
  <pre><code>  trait Inj1 {
    implicit def dbConfig: DbConfig
  }

  trait Inj2 {
    implicit def webServiceConfig: WebServiceConfig
  }

  trait Mega extends Inj1 with Inj2  // fine</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't break the chain! Any child class that needs an implicit config type
      injected must have that implicit (or explicit) parameter from the parent.
      Parents can broaden the type they have injected but not narrow it.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Parfait pattern is a useful abstraction for injecting dependencies and loosening
    coupling between classes, concepts and modules in Scala applications without
    sacrificing full compile-time verifiability and reasonable performance from
    either the runtime or compile time aspects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like any Dependency Injection approach, it is not without its quirks, for example
    care must be taken when using implicit configuration in traits in order to
    avoid type signature clashes on members, and also relies on an unbroken chain
    of implicits passed down from parent to child. On the other hand it provides
    compile time safety and full type checking, decent compile-time and run-time
    performance, a simple model and minimal boilerplate without requiring the use
    of any third party libraries, macros or compiler plugins.
